3.0.1 - 2019-03-04
    * Bugfixes:
      * The code which validates that loaded zonefile RRs are not oversized for
        implementation limits (~16KB encoded response data per RR Set) was
        having its results thrown away, nullifying the validation.  Now the
        limit is checked properly, and zonefiles containing such data will be
        rejected at load time.
      * Minor fix for UDP error statistics, in a corner case on platforms that
        do not have the recvmmsg()/sendmmsg() syscalls, where sometimes what
        should've incremented the UDP "recvfail" stat instead incremented the
        "dropped" stat.
      * Daemon no longer exits with an error if asked for resource states info
        over the control socket ("gdnsdctl states") when no such states are
        configured at all.
      * Removed redundant and outdated help string for "-i" from gdnsdctl's
        usage output.

3.0.0 - 2019-02-15
    * Note that this is a major version number bump, and for some users and
      configurations this means major compatibility-breaking changes.  Do not
      expect a simple upgrade like a minor version release!  Please see the
      separate file VERSION3.md which offers an overview of all the major
      changes from 2.x; there's too much to succinctly summarize here.
    * Also, all previous NEWS entries were shifted to NEWS.old, so that we can
      start this file over and leave previous 2146 lines of updates behind.
    * For beta users: there were no functional changes since the final
      2.99.9950-beta release, only QA/refactoring work and a couple of
      FreeBSD-specific fixups to the TCP parts of the testsuite.
