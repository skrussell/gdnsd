Description: authoritative domain name server
 gdnsd is an Authoritative-only DNS server. The initial g stands for
 Geographic, as gdnsd offers a plugin system for geographic (or other sorts of)
 balancing, redirection, and service-state-conscious failover.
 .
 gdnsd has a strong focus on high performance, low latency service. It does
 not offer any form of caching or recursive service, and does not support
 DNSSEC.
 .
 This package provides the core gdnsd daemon and basic plugins.
